## Description
Currently, the browser provides a method for developers to upload Token Info via email to the developer community. However, this method is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of new frameworks like Kuai for SUDT development. Instead, an API for Token Info uploading should be introduced as a replacement. 

For API part, it’s sure that: 
1. It will be open for all UDT project.
2. Uploading info function has a limit from tech side to ensure the service work normally.
3. Uploading info needs admin to approve.

So a workflow are also supposed be added to ensure the TokenInfo can only be modified to the Token creator. Here’s the flow chart to avoid some attacks like update the decimal to make transfer amount 10x than it's, so the attacker can cheat others by claiming that he/she has sent 10x sudt.

Notes: Because the Author Emails was not required in elder Token Info, these token’s Author Email should be set as CKB Explorer’s  official email address.
