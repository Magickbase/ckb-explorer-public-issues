| 区块详情页 | Size | The block size is actually determined by the block's gas limit. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Cycles | Cycles are fees paid to miners based on the amount of computer resources that are used to verify a transaction. These are measured by CKB-VM during the execution of any smart contracts in a transaction. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Proposal Transactions | In CKB, Proposal Transactions refer to transactions that are created by miners and submitted to the network as a proposal to include a new block in the blockchain. Proposal Transactions contain a list of transactions that the miner has selected to include in the new block, as well as other information such as the block header and the Proof of Work (PoW) solution. When a miner creates a Proposal Transaction, they are essentially competing with other miners to have their block included in the blockchain. The first miner to have their Proposal Transaction accepted by the network and added to the blockchain is rewarded with the Proposal Reward, which is a combination of the transaction fees and the block subsidy. Proposal Transactions are an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB, as they allow miners to compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and maintain the security and integrity of the network. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Miner Reward | Native tokens that are paid to a miner in exchange for providing the computational resources required for mining. | To be confirmed | https://docs-old.nervos.org/glossary/glossary-general#mining-reward |

| 区块详情页 | Nonce | In CKB, Nonce refers to a 64-bit field in the block header that is used to adjust the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining. The Nonce field is a random value that is added to the block header and hashed together with other fields in the header to produce a hash value that meets the current difficulty target. Miners must perform a large number of hash calculations using different Nonce values in order to find a value that meets the difficulty target. The Nonce is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB, as it helps to ensure that the network remains secure and that miners are incentivized to continue mining the network. | To be confirmed | - |

| 区块详情页 | Epoch | In CKB, an Epoch is a fixed period of time during which the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining is held constant. The duration of an Epoch is set to 4 hours, and all the blocks in the same Epoch share the same difficulty target. The difficulty adjustment algorithm aims to stabilize the orphan block rate at 2.5% by adjusting the difficulty level for each Epoch based on the average block time of the previous Epoch. The Epoch is used to ensure that the network remains secure and that miners are incentivized to continue mining the network. The Epoch concept is used in many other blockchain networks as well, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Epoch Start Number | In CKB, Epoch Start Number refers to the block number at which a new Epoch begins. The Epoch Start Number is calculated based on the number of blocks that have been mined since the last Epoch started. Specifically, the Epoch Start Number is equal to the current block number minus the remainder of the current block number divided by the Epoch length. For example, if the current block number is 1000 and the Epoch length is 180 blocks, then the Epoch Start Number would be 1000 - (1000 % 180) = 940. The Epoch Start Number is used to determine when the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining should be adjusted, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Block Index | In CKB, Block Index refers to the numerical index assigned to a block in the blockchain. The Block Index is a unique identifier for each block in the chain, and is used to order the blocks in the blockchain. The first block in the chain, also known as the Genesis Block, has a Block Index of 0, and each subsequent block is assigned the next sequential index. The Block Index is an important component of the blockchain, as it is used to maintain the integrity and security of the network by ensuring that all nodes on the network agree on the ordering of the blocks in the chain. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Timestamp | In CKB, Timestamp refers to the timestamp of a block, which represents the time at which the block was created by a miner. The Timestamp is included in the block header as a 64-bit integer value, and is used to order the blocks in the blockchain. The Timestamp is important for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain, as it helps to prevent attacks such as double-spending and timestamp manipulation. However, it is worth noting that the Timestamp in CKB is not an accurate representation of real-world time, as it is based on the miner's local clock and can be subject to variance and manipulation. Instead, the Timestamp is used to enforce a relative ordering of blocks in the blockchain, with the goal of ensuring that all nodes on the network agree on the state of the blockchain. | To be confirmed | - |
| 区块详情页 | Transactions Root | In CKB, Transactions Root refers to the root of a Merkle tree that contains the transaction hashes of all the transactions included in a block. The Transactions Root is calculated by hashing together all of the transaction hashes in the Merkle tree, and is included in the block header as a way of verifying the integrity of the transactions in the block. The Transactions Root is used to ensure that all of the transactions in the block are valid and that none have been tampered with. It is also used to efficiently retrieve a specific transaction from a block, as the Merkle tree structure allows for quick verification of the transaction's inclusion in the block. The Transactions Root is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB, and is used to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. | To be confirmed | - |

The CellDeps field is used to specify the dependencies required by the transaction, such as code or data cells. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Witnesses | Witnesses is a field in the CKB transaction structure that contains an array of witness data. Each element in the array corresponds to a Cell in the transaction's inputs. Witnesses are used to provide additional data that is required to unlock a Cell's capacity. This data is used to verify that the transaction is authorized to spend the Cells it is trying to consume. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Lock Script | Lock Script in CKB is a script that is attached to a Cell's lock field. It is used to enforce certain conditions that must be met in order to spend the Cell's capacity. The Lock Script can be thought of as the Cell's "owner", as it defines the conditions under which the Cell's capacity can be spent. The Lock Script is executed by the CKB VM during the transaction verification process. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Type Script | Type Script in CKB is a script that is attached to a Cell's type field. It is used to enforce additional validation rules on the Cell's data. The Type Script can be used to define custom data formats, or to implement more complex validation logic beyond what is possible with the Lock Script alone. The Type Script is executed by the CKB VM during the transaction verification process. | To be confirmed | - |

| - | deprecated addresses | "what is deprecated addresses in CKB | - | - |
| Deprecated addresses in CKB refer to old address formats that are no longer recommended for use. These addresses were used in earlier versions of the CKB protocol, but have since been replaced by newer, more secure address formats. While deprecated addresses can still be used to send and receive transactions, it is recommended to use the newer address formats for improved security and compatibility with future versions of the CKB protocol." | To be confirmed | - | - | - |
| Script详情页 | Script Name | Script refers to the script data structure used by Lock Script and Type Script in the Cell data structure. It contains three fields: code hash, hash type, and args. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Script Type | Script Name refers to the name of a script file that contains the source code for a CKB script. This is the file that is compiled into the binary code that is deployed to the CKB network. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Code Hash | Code Hash in CKB is a field in the Script data structure that represents the hash of the script code. It is used to uniquely identify the script code that is associated with a particular Cell. The Code Hash is calculated using the blake2b hash function, and is used by the CKB VM to locate and execute the script code during transaction verification. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Hash Type | Hash Type in CKB is a field in the Script data structure that specifies how the Code Hash field should be interpreted when looking for script code to run from cell dependencies. If the Hash Type field contains "data", then the Code Hash should match the blake2b hash of the actual script code in a dep cell. If the Hash Type field contains "type", then the Code Hash should match the blake2b hash of the Type Script contained by a dep cell. The combination of a Code Hash and a Hash Type field uniquely identifies a script code in CKB. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Type Id | Type ID in CKB is a unique identifier for a Type Script that is used to reference it from other Cells. It is a blake2b hash of the Type Script code, and is calculated by the CKB VM when the script is deployed to the network. The Type ID can be used to reference the Type Script in other Cells, and is used to enforce additional validation rules on the Cell's data. | To be confirmed | - |
| - | Capacity of deployed cells | Capacity of deployed cells in CKB refers to the maximum amount of space (in bytes) that a cell can occupy on the Nervos CKB. The capacity field is one of the four fields in the Cell data structure, and limits the size of the cell. In order to store data on the CKB, a user must hold 1 CKB for every 1 byte of space that the cell occupies. This means that the capacity of a cell directly affects the amount of CKB that a user must hold in order to store data on the network. | To be confirmed | - |
| 地址详情页 | Live Cells | Live Cells in CKB refer to unspent cells on the blockchain that contain assets owned by users. They are similar to Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in Bitcoin. Live Cells hold the current state of the network, and any transaction on CKB consumes some of these cells and creates new ones. The full set of Live Cells in CKB represents the full state of the network at a particular point in time. Live Cells are the primary state units in CKB and are used to store arbitrary common knowledge, including assets such as tokens, smart contracts, and other data. | To be confirmed | - |

| - | Secondary Issuance | Secondary Issuance in CKB refers to a fixed inflation schedule of 1.344 billion CKBytes per year that is used to incentivize miners, Nervos DAO users, and the Nervos Treasury for continued development. Unlike Base Issuance, Secondary Issuance is not distributed to everyone on the network, but rather targeted at users who occupy space on Nervos or hold their CKBytes outside of Nervos DAO. The CKBytes from Secondary Issuance are used to collect state rent and are distributed to miners who maintain the network (State Rent), Nervos DAO users, and the Nervos Treasury. CKBytes holders can lock their tokens in Nervos DAO to gain interest in a similar manner to staking on other platforms, which offsets the long-term inflationary effects of Secondary Issuance exactly, resulting in no loss of value over time. | To be confirmed | - |

| - | NRC 721 | NRC-721 is a token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Nervos CKB blockchain. It is similar to the ERC-721 token standard used on the Ethereum blockchain, and provides a common interface for creating, managing, and transferring unique digital assets on the CKB network. NRC-721 tokens are unique and non-interchangeable, which makes them ideal for representing assets such as collectibles, game items, and other unique digital assets. | To be confirmed | - |
| 图表页 | Hash Rate | Hash Rate is a measure of the computational power per second used when mining a cryptocurrency. It represents the number of hash operations that can be performed by a miner in a given period of time. In the context of blockchain, hash rate is used to measure the amount of work that is being done by the network to maintain the blockchain. A higher hash rate indicates that the network is more secure, as it becomes more difficult for a malicious actor to perform a 51% attack. | To be confirmed | - |
