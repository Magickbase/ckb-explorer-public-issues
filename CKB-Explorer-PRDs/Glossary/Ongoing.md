| / | Cell | CKB adopts cell model, which is more generic than UTXO model. A transaction destroys some outputs created in previous transactions and creates some new outputs. Every transaction's output is a cell. | checked(sven) | [transaction struc](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#code-locating)  |
| / | Live Cell | A live cell is the one that appears as an output but not as an input in all the older transactions. A dead cell has already been used as an input in any older transaction. A transaction can only use live cells as inputs. | checked(sven) | [transaction struc](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#code-locating) |
| / | Capacity | The Capacity in the cell is not only just the amount of the stored tokens, but it is also a limit on how many data the cell can store.

| 区块详情页 | Size | Block Size refers to the size of a block, typically used to describe the number of transactions within a block. The block size is actually determined by the block's gas limit. | checked(sven) | - |
| 区块详情页 | Cycles | Cycles are fees paid to miners based on the amount of computer resources that are used to verify a transaction. These are measured by CKB-VM during the execution of any smart contracts in a transaction. | checked(sven) | - |
| 区块详情页 | Proposal Transactions | In CKB,a proposal refers to the first step in the confirmation process of a transaction. NC-MAX splits the confirmation process into two steps: propose and commit. During the proposal step, a transaction is first proposed to the network. This involves broadcasting the transaction to the network and allowing it to propagate among the nodes. The proposal step gives more time for transaction propagation without slowing down block propagation.| checked(sven) | [NC-MAX](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1101.pdf) |

| 区块详情页 | Epoch | In CKB, an Epoch is a fixed period of time during which the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining is held constant. The duration of an Epoch is set to 4 hours, so the actual Epoch interval is always **around** 4 hours, and all the blocks in the same Epoch share the same difficulty target. The difficulty adjustment algorithm aims to stabilize the orphan block rate at 2.5% by adjusting the difficulty level for each Epoch based on the average block time of the previous Epoch. The Epoch is used to ensure that the network remains secure and that miners are incentivized to continue mining the network. The Epoch concept is used in many other blockchain networks as well, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism. | checked(sven) | [CKB doc](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary#epoch) |
| 区块详情页 | Epoch Start Number | In CKB, Epoch Start Number refers to the block number at which a new Epoch begins. The Epoch Start Number is calculated based on the number of blocks that have been mined since the last Epoch started. Specifically, the Epoch Start Number is equal to the current block number minus the remainder of the current block number divided by the Epoch length. For example, if the current block number is 1000 and the Epoch length is 180 blocks, then the Epoch Start Number would be 1000 - (1000 % 180) = 940. The Epoch Start Number is used to determine when the difficulty level for Proof of Work (PoW) mining should be adjusted, and is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB. | checked(sven) | - |
| 区块详情页 | Block Index | In CKB, Block Index refers to the numerical index assigned to a block in the blockchain. The Block Index is a unique identifier for each block in the chain, and is used to order the blocks in the blockchain. The first block in the chain, also known as the Genesis Block, has a Block Index of 0, and each subsequent block is assigned the next sequential index. The Block Index is an important component of the blockchain, as it is used to maintain the integrity and security of the network by ensuring that all nodes on the network agree on the ordering of the blocks in the chain. | checked(sven) | [more info](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/9aef152a5123c8972de1aefc11794cf84d1762ed/rfcs/0027-block-structure/0027-block-structure.md#epoch-uint64) |
| 区块详情页 | Timestamp | In CKB, Timestamp refers to the timestamp of a block, which represents the time at which the block was created by a miner. However , the timestamp in the block header is an arbitrary value filled by the miner.| checked(sven),revised(Chenyu) | - |
| 区块详情页 | Transactions Root | In CKB, Transactions Root refers to the root of a Merkle tree that contains the transaction hashes of all the transactions included in a block. The Transactions Root is calculated by hashing together all of the transaction hashes in the Merkle tree, and is included in the block header as a way of verifying the integrity of the transactions in the block. The Transactions Root is used to ensure that all of the transactions in the block are valid and that none have been tampered with. It is also used to efficiently retrieve a specific transaction from a block, as the Merkle tree structure allows for quick verification of the transaction's inclusion in the block. The Transactions Root is an important component of the consensus mechanism in CKB. | checked(sven) | - |

| 交易详情页 | Lock Script | Lock Script in CKB is a script that is attached to a Cell's lock field. Every cell has a lock script.It is used to enforce certain conditions that must be met in order to spend the Cell's capacity. The Lock Script can be thought of as the Cell's "owner", as it defines the conditions under which the Cell's capacity can be spent. The Lock Script is executed by the CKB VM during the transaction verification process. | checked(sven) | - |
| 交易详情页 | Type Script | Type Script in CKB is a script that is attached to a Cell's type field. It is used to enforce additional validation rules on the Cell's data. The Type Script can be used to define custom data formats, or to implement more complex validation logic beyond what is possible with the Lock Script alone. The Type Script is executed by the CKB VM during the transaction verification process. Type script is optional. CKB run the type scripts in both inputs and outputs in a transaction.| checked(sven) | - |

| Script详情页 | Capacity of deployed cells | Capacity of deployed cells in CKB refers to the maximum amount of space (in bytes) that a cell can occupy on the Nervos CKB. The capacity field is one of the four fields in the Cell data structure, and limits the size of the cell. In order to store data on the CKB, a user must hold 1 CKB for every 1 byte of space that the cell occupies. This means that the capacity of a cell directly affects the amount of CKB that a user must hold in order to store data on the network. | checked(sven) | - |

| - | Secondary Issuance | Secondary Issuance in CKB refers to a fixed inflation schedule of 1.344 billion CKBytes per year that is used to incentivize miners, Nervos DAO users, and the Nervos Treasury for continued development. Unlike Base Issuance, Secondary Issuance is not distributed to everyone on the network, but rather targeted at users who occupy space on Nervos or hold their CKBytes outside of Nervos DAO. The CKBytes from Secondary Issuance are used to collect state rent and are distributed to miners who maintain the network (State Rent), Nervos DAO users, and the Nervos Treasury. CKBytes holders can lock their tokens in Nervos DAO to gain interest in a similar manner to staking on other platforms, which offsets the long-term inflationary effects of Secondary Issuance exactly, resulting in no loss of value over time. | checked(sven) | - |
